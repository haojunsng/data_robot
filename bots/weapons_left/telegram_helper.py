I'm here to help you split bills with your crew! Here's how to use me:

🍖 *EXAMPLES:* 🍖

_Equal Split_
- Best for when you're just splitting the bill equally with people who paid different amounts - Chomp Chomp / Newton Circus / Bedok85.
```
/split
Luffy 50
Zoro 30
Nami 0
Usopp 20
```

_Advanced Split_
- Best when your party had individual expenses and shared expenses.
- Add "no surcharges" at the end if expenses are already nett.
```
/split2
payer Luffy
share all 25 15 10
share Zoro Nami 30
share Nami Usopp 20
Zoro 23 1.9
Name 20 5.8 1.9
Usopp 10
no surcharges
```

✨ _FEATURES:_ ✨\n
• Automatically calculates who owes what.
• Minimizes the number of transactions needed
• Handles any number of people
• GST + Service Charge calculations (Singapore)


🚀 *Ready to split?* Just send me `/split` or `/split2` followed by your expenses!"""
